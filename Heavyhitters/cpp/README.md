# data stream - Heavy Hitter / stream trend

This algorithm is implemented with std::map as well as std::vector. Below is a directory structure
HeavyHitter_using_map       : Implementation using std::map. 
HeavyHitter_using_vector    : Implementation using std::vector.

The implementation with map, i am actually removing all the elements whose counter becomes zero after reducing the counter. Where as in the other implementation (using vector) i am just replacing the elements and not really removing from the vector
